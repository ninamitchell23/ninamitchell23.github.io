        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            Our food donation app is dedicated to reducing food waste and supporting those in need. 
            We connect donors with local charities and food banks to ensure surplus food reaches those who can benefit from it the most.

        <h2 style="color: #333;">How It Works</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
            Our app makes it easy for donors to list surplus food items, which are then picked up by our partner charities. 
            We ensure that the food is safely transported and distributed to those in need.
